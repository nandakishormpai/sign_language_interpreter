<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was initialised during Hack MIT 2020 , Sep 19-20 2020.
We decided to make a Sign Language Translator as we felt it as a socially relevant and technically feasible objective. We got a well diverse dataset form kaggle and we started building a CNN neurla net and accomplihed a model that can understand all the alphabets used in ASL and can help the other person communicate with deaf people. Real time prediction makes this project usable in our lives. Integration with Flask to host this a web app for others to access escalated the usability.
